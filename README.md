## 🚀 Features

### Core 3D Engine
- **Real-time 3D rendering** with Three.js WebGL renderer
- **Interactive camera controls** with orbit, pan, zoom, and first-person modes
- **Shadow mapping** with PCF soft shadows
- **Dynamic lighting system** with adjustable directional light

### Model Management
- **FBX model loading** with automatic scaling and centering
- **Interactive model selection** with visual feedback
- **Sample geometry generation** for quick testing
- **Asset browser** with thumbnail view and management tools

### Advanced Material System
- **Custom shader editor** with real-time compilation
- **Live material preview** on selected meshes
- **Shadow integration** in custom shaders
- **Material library** with save/load functionality
- **Original material restoration** system

### User Interface
- **Responsive design** with professional dark theme
- **Tabbed content browser** for models and materials
- **Real-time light controller** with azimuth, elevation, and intensity
- **Code editor** with syntax highlighting for GLSL shaders
- **Status indicators** for loading states and selections

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with functional components and hooks
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js with WebGL renderer
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS with inline styles for component isolation
- **File Handling**: FBXLoader for 3D model import

## 🏗 Architecture

### Component Structure
```
SimpleWebEngine/
├── SimpleWebEngine.jsx      # Main application component
├── ContentBrowser.jsx       # Asset and material management UI
├── LightController.jsx      # Real-time lighting controls
├── MaterialEditor.jsx       # Shader code editor with live preview
└── hooks/

```

### Key Design Patterns
- **Custom Hooks**: Modular logic separation for reusability
- **Component Composition**: Flexible UI component architecture
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state with prop drilling
- **Resource Management**: Proper disposal of Three.js resources

## 🎮 Controls

| Action | Input |
|--------|-------|

## 💡 Usage

### Loading Models
1. Click "Load FBX" to import your 3D models
2. Use "Sample" to generate test geometry
3. Models appear in the Models tab of the content browser

### Creating Materials
1. Click "+ New" in the Materials tab
2. Edit GLSL fragment shader code in the material editor
3. Save to compile and add to your material library

### Applying Materials
1. Select a 3D mesh by clicking on it
2. Choose a material from the Materials tab
3. Click the green checkmark (✓) to apply
4. Use "Revert" to restore original materials

### Lighting Control
- Adjust **Azimuth** for horizontal light rotation
- Modify **Elevation** for vertical light angle
- Control **Intensity** for brightness
- Click "Reset" to return to default settings
